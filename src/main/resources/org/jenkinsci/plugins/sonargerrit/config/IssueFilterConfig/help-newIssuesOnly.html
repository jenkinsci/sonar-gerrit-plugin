        When using the SonarQube 7 configuration only new issues will be reported even if this checkbox is unchecked.
        This is due to the fact, that
        <a href="https://docs.sonarqube.org/7.9/analysis/pull-request/">SonarQube 7 - Pull Request Analysis </a>
        only contains new issues.
